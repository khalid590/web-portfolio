                <h2>Become a professional Web Developer</h2>

                websites, such as ecommerce, news, or gaming sites, to fit clients' needs. Different types of websites require different
                applications. For example, a gaming site should be able to handle advanced graphics, whereas an ecommerce site would
                need a payment-processing application. The developer decides which applications and designs will best fit the site..</p>

                    applications using a client–server model. The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP,
